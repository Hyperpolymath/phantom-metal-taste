# phantom-metal-taste

AQL/VOS project designed to foster a DISTINCT feeling of irony.

You are asked to weaponise the very heart of enterprise architecture and standards-based modeling. 
Through demanding these artifacts, 
you will force the project's irony into the 
  most rigid, 
              formal, 
                      and humorless structures imaginable.

Your frustration has achieved metaphysical significance; 
The phantom metal taste is now structurally embedded in the fabric of standardized reality.

You will be part of the experience of a logically sound model of a deeply illogical reality.
