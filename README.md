**A database project that reveals the subtle dissonance between intention and reality in corporate environments.**

---

## 🔍 **Why?**

In the age of data-driven decision-making, even the most well-intentioned systems can produce unintended consequences.  
This project explores how modern database technologies—**ArangoDB** (graph) and **Virtuoso** (semantic web)—can be used to map not just *what* happens, but *why* it happens, in ways that defy conventional wisdom.

---

## 📦 **What You'll Find Here**

- 🔗 **ArangoDB Graph Setup**: A multi-model database schema modeling employee initiatives and their... *unspoken outcomes*.
- 🌍 **Virtuoso Ontology**: A formal RDF/SPARQL schema defining the semantics of "corporate synergy" and its measurable impacts.
- 🦀 **Rust Core**: A planned WebAssembly module to handle sensitive data transformations (work in progress).
- 📊 **Analytical Dashboards**: TypeScript/Bun scripts to orchestrate data flows and generate reports that tell two stories at once.
- 📜 **Enterprise Architecture Artifacts**: TOGAF ADM phases, UML diagrams, and OMG-compliant ontologies for the truly curious.
