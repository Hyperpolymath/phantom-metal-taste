/* PHILOSOPHY */

This project measures the gap between:
- What organizations say they value
- What they actually incentivize
- Stated intentions
- Actual outcomes
- Metric targets
- Gaming behaviors

The irony: Building a perfect measurement system
to critique imperfect measurement systems.

The meta-irony: Documenting our documentation process
in a humans.txt file that may be read by AI.

The meta-meta-irony: Acknowledging AI assistance
in a file called "humans.txt".
